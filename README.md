This is not the standard way to submit content and this is why it is not very user-friendly. This is supposed to be more for the website programmers. The ultimate goal is to have an editor on the website that is much more user-friendly for submitting and editing content.

How to get your own copy:
--
* Make sure you have a GitHub account.
* Visit the reposity here: https://github.com/AnarchAcademy/master
* Click the button in the top right labeled "Fork" and select your own account.

At this point you will have a complete copy of the AnarchAcademy website in your github account. You can feel free to make changes, add files, etc. This requires some knowledge of git itself, but there are programs that make using git quite easy.

How to have your edits applied to the main copy:
--
Once you are done editing, you can send a "pull request" to the AnarchAcademy copy as follows:
* Visit your reposity (copy). The website address will be something like: https://github.com/<username>/master
* Click the button labeled "Pull Request". It is to the left of button labeled "Compare".
* Click the "Create Pull Request" button (big and green) and fill out any fields you feel are important.
* Click the "Send Pull Request" button (also big and green).

After you follow these steps, the AnarchAcademy members will be able to accept or deny your request, and everyone can comment on it.
